        (F) Proposed model of ABCA7 dysfunction in neurons: ABCA7 loss-of-function (LoF) induces a compositional shift away from phosphatidylcholines (PCs) (1,2), which may directly increase triglycerides (TGs) by increasing precursor availability (3, 4) or indirectly by impairing lipid droplet processing (5) and mitochondrial uncoupling (6). Impaired uncoupling can lead to multiple detrimental cellular effects, including a decreased ability to meet the cellâs energy demand, impaired regulation of carbon breakdown via oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), and increased oxidative stress (7).
