Over 50 million people worldwide have dementia, with a large fraction of cases caused by Alzheimer‚Äôs disease\cite{Alzheimers_Disease_International2020-xv}. Late-onset Alzheimer‚Äôs Disease (AD) affects individuals over the age of 65 and accounts for more than 95\% of all AD cases\cite{Alzheimers_Association2016-vq}. Though AD is a multifactorial disorder, twin studies suggest a strong genetic component (~70\% heritability)\cite{Karlsson2022-vv} contributing to AD disease risk and progression. Large scale genome-wide association studies implicate multiple genes in AD etiology\cite{Lambert2013-km,Marioni2019-os,Jansen2019-ww,Kunkle2019-yo,De_Rojas2021-gu,Wightman2021-km,Bellenguez2022-ao,Belloy2023-kj}. After APOE4, rare loss-of-function (LoF) mutations caused by premature termination codons (PTCs) in ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 (ABCA7), are among the strongest genetic factors for AD (odds ratio ~ 2)\cite{Steinberg2015-mu,De_Roeck2019-te,Reitz2013-eo,Bellenguez2022-ao,Holstege2022-vp,Lyssenko2021-gw}. In addition to LoF variants, several common single nucleotide polymorphisms in ABCA7 - depending on the population - moderately\cite{Steinberg2015-mu,De_Roeck2019-te,Reitz2013-eo,Bellenguez2022-ao,Le_Guennec2016-nl,Hollingworth2011-tr,Naj2011-bs} to strongly\cite{Reitz2013-eo} increase AD risk, suggesting that ABCA7 dysfunction may play a role in a significant proportion of AD cases. Despite its prevalence and potential impact, the mechanism by which ABCA7 dysfunction increases AD risk remains poorly characterized. 

ABCA7 is a member of the A subfamily of ABC transmembrane proteins\cite{Kim2008-zi} with high sequence homology to ABCA1, the primary lipid transporter responsible for cholesterol homeostasis and high-density lipoprotein genesis in the brain\cite{Koldamova2014-kd}. ABCA7 effluxes both cholesterol and phospholipids to APOA-I and APOE in in vitro studies\cite{Abe-Dohmae2004-wb,Wang2003-wh,Tomioka2017-nv,Picataggi2022-yp,Quazi2013-pe,Fang2025} and has been shown to be a critical regulator of lipid metabolism, immune cell functions, and amyloid processing\cite{Aikawa2018-ek,Tanaka2011-zo,Duchateau2023-ji,Kawatani2023-vf,Tayran2024-bo}. To date, study of ABCA7 LoF has been predominantly pursued in rodent knock-out models or in non-neural mammalian cell lines. These studies show that ABCA7 knock-out or missense variants  cause increased amyloid processing and deposition\cite{Satoh2015-yu,Sakae2016-uy,Chan2008-qu,Bamji-Mirza2018-xt}, reduced plaque clearance by astrocytes and microglia\cite{Kim2013-sv,Fu2016-qe}, and that ABCA7 LoF alters glial-mediated inflammatory responses\cite{Aikawa2019-hv,Aikawa2021-vz}.  While these studies shed light on potential mechanisms of ABCA7 risk in AD, studies investigating the effects of ABCA7 LoF in human cells and tissue are severely lacking, with only a small number published to date\cite{Kawatani2023-vf,Allen2017-vw,Liu2021-zh,Bamji-Mirza2018-xt}.  These human studies highlight a number of potential LoF-induced defects in human cells, including impacts on lipid metabolism and mitochondrial function\cite{Kawatani2023-vf}. However, comprehensive and unbiased profiling of multiple human neural cell types is needed to elucidate the mechanism by which ABCA7 LoF increases AD risk.

Single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) of human neural tissue has identified cell type-specific transcriptional changes associated with Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk variants such as APOE4 and TREM2 \cite{Brase2023-xk,Blanchard2022-cf,Sayed2021-qn,Wamsley2024-zm,Kamath2022-if}, providing insights into disease mechanisms and potential therapies. Here, we generated a cell type-specific transcriptomic atlas of ABCA7 loss-of-function (LoF) in the human prefrontal cortex (PFC). SnRNA-seq of postmortem brain tissue from ABCA7 LoF variant carriers and matched controls revealed widespread transcriptional alterations, particularly in excitatory neurons, which express the highest ABCA7 levels. These neurons displayed disruptions in lipid metabolism, mitochondrial respiration, DNA damage response, and synaptic function. Similar transcriptional changes were observed in neurons carrying the common missense variant p.Ala1527Gly, which structural simulations suggest impairs ABCA7 function. This overlap indicates that p.Ala1527Gly may exert effects comparable to ABCA7 LoF, extending the relevance of our findings to a broader group of the at-risk population.

To complement our transcriptomic findings, we examined induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons harboring ABCA7 LoF variants. These neurons exhibited significant transcriptional overlap with human PFC neurons affected by ABCA7 LoF. Additionally, they demonstrated impaired mitochondrial respiration, hyperpolarized mitochondrial membrane potential, and elevated reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels. Consistent with ABCA7's known role in phospholipid transport, we observed alterations in lipid composition, notably an increase in saturated phosphatidylcholine. Enhancing de novo phosphatidylcholine synthesis through CDP-choline supplementation effectively reversed ABCA7 LoF-induced transcriptional changes, restored mitochondrial function, decreased ROS production, normalized secreted amyloid-beta (AŒ≤) levels, and rescued neuronal hyperexcitability. These findings link metabolic disruptions to AD pathology and suggest that neuronal ABCA7 may impact mitochondrial function through phosphatidylcholine imbalance, highlighting a potential mechanism by which ABCA7 variants increase AD risk.

%Experiments in iPSC-derived neurons (iNs) 
% Experiments in iPSC-derived neurons (iNs) revealed a metabolic shift away from phosphatidylcholine synthesis towards triglyceride accumulation in the presence of ABCA7 LoF, trends which were also observed in the postmortem human brain. This shift coincided with widespread metabolic changes related to carbon catabolism through mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS), indicating that ABCA7 LoF neurons may have decreased ability to metabolize lipids. Promoting phosphatidylcholine synthesis and reducing triglyceride accumulation by supplementing iNs with CDP-choline, a rate-limiting precursor for phosphatidylcholine synthesis, ameliorated this shift, suggesting that ABCA7 LoF-induced lipid disruptions mediate mitochondrial dysfunction in neurons. Supplementation with CDP-choline also rescued intracellular AùõΩ42, the toxic form of amyloid-Œ≤\cite{Pauwels2012-ul,Fraser1991-tj,Pike1993-xs,Pettegrew2001-sm,Phillips2019-ev}, which was up-regulated in ABCA7 LoF neurons, suggesting a potential link between ABCA7 LoF-induced metabolic defects and AD pathology.

% Together, our data suggest that neuronal ABCA7 plays an integral role in regulating intracellular lipid homeostasis critical for mitochondrial function. Our study reveals new insights into the mechanism through which damaging ABCA7 variants, including common ABCA7 missense variants, may increase AD risk by disrupting energy homeostasis in the cell.
