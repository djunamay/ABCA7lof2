\paragraph{Oxygen consumption rate data analysis.}
The oxygen consumption rate (OCR) of cells was determined over time using a Seahorse XF Analyzer. Prior to analysis, OCR curves were visually inspected in a blinded manner to exclude wells that did not respond to drug injections. To calculate per-well total oxygen consumption for a given experimental period (e.g., under basal conditions prior to injections of uncouplers), integrals between specific experimental time points were computed from the OCR curve. The following measurements were made:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Basal respiration was computed as the total oxygen consumption prior to oligomycin injection.
    \item Proton leak was computed as the total oxygen consumed after oligomycin injection and prior to FCCP injection.
    \item Maximal respiration was computed as the total oxygen consumption after FCCP and prior to Rotenone + Antimycin injection.
    \item Relative uncoupling was computed as the fraction of basal respiration attributed to proton leak.
    \item Spare respiratory capacity was determined as the ratio of basal respiration to maximal respiration.
\end{enumerate}
