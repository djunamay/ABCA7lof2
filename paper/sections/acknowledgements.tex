\paragraph{Ethics Statement:} The study protocol involving the use of human stem cells was approved by the Coriell Institutional Review Board (Coriell IRB) in compliance with DHHS regulations (45 CFR Part 46). The initial cell lines were obtained from the Coriell Institute, which ensured that informed consent was received from all donors. Donors were informed that their tissue donations would be used for the creation of cell lines intended for educational and research purposes, and that all biological materials would be anonymized. More information can be found here. For postmortem human brain samples, informed consent was obtained from each subject, and the Religious Orders Study and Rush Memory and Aging Project were approved by an Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Rush University Medical Center.


\paragraph{Data availability:} All postmortem human data can be accessed through the Synapse AD Knowledge Portal (syn53461705), which also includes associated ROSMAP metadata. These data are subject to controlled access in compliance with human privacy regulations. To obtain the data, a data use agreement (DUA) must be completed. This requirement ensures the anonymity of ROSMAP study participants. A DUA can be established with either the Rush University Medical Center (RUMC) or SAGE, the organization that manages Synapse. The necessary forms are available for download on their respective websites. All iPSC-related data are accessible through links provided in our code repositories. For a complete list of data availability and download links, please refer to the code repositories listed below. Additionally, relevant processed datasets are available in the supplementary files of this manuscript.


\paragraph{Code availability:} All code used in this study is available on GitHub. This includes code to replicate the analyses and figure panels presented in the paper (\url{https://github.com/djunamay/ABCA7lof2}), descriptions and code for accessing whole-genome sequencing data (\url{https://github.com/djunamay/ROSMAPwgs}), code for performing gene-pathway clustering (\url{https://github.com/djunamay/geneclusters}), and code for processing confocal images (\url{https://github.com/djunamay/confocalQuant}).
