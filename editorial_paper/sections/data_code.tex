\textbf{Data availability}\newline\newline
All postmortem human data can be accessed through the Synapse AD Knowledge Portal (syn53461705), which also includes associated ROSMAP metadata. These data are subject to controlled access in compliance with human privacy regulations and can be requested via the AD Knowledge Portal (https://adknowledgeportal.synapse.org/Data\%20Access). Briefly, you must register for a Synapse account, followed by completing a Data Use Certificate (DUC), here: https://help.adknowledgeportal.org/apd/Data-Use-Certificates.2623373330.html, which will take approximately 1 week to be approved. Upon approval, data can be accessed and downloaded for one year. Bulk mRNA-sequencing data are available via the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession number GSE299277. Imaging data are available via Dandi. Remaining data are available via Dryad. External datasets used are detailed in Supplementary Table 3. Also see our GitHub repositroy for a full overview.
