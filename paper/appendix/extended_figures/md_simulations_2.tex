    \begin{itemize}
        \item[\textbf{(A)}] Phi vs. Psi dihedral angle distribution of residue 1527 as a function of simulation time for open and closed conformations.
        \item[\textbf{(B)}] Overall Phi vs. Psi dihedral angle distributions for residue 1527, comparing open and closed conformations throughout the entire simulation period.
        \item[\textbf{(C)}] Time-resolved secondary structure assignments for residues 1517–1537. Alpha-helical structures are highlighted in red; other colors represent distinct secondary structures.
        \item[\textbf{(D)}] Fraction of alpha-helical content observed for residues 1517–1537 during the simulations. A value of 1 indicates uninterrupted preservation of the alpha-helical structure throughout the simulation duration.
        \item[\textbf{(E)}] ABCA1 (cyan) closed structure; PDB ID: 7TBW. ABCA7 (purple) closed structure; PDB ID: 8EOP. Positions of Gly1527 in ABCA7 and V1646 in ABCA1 are indicated as spheres.
        \item[\textbf{(F)}] ABCA4 (green) closed structure; PDB ID: 7LKZ. ABCA7 (purple) closed structure; PDB ID: 8EOP. Positions of Gly1527 in ABCA7 and I1671 in ABCA4 are indicated as spheres.
