\subsubsection{Data availability}
The primary post‑mortem human multi‑omics dataset generated in this study is deposited in the AD Knowledge Portal under Synapse ID syn53461705 (https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn53461705). Because the data contain potentially re‑identifiable human information, access is controlled. Researchers with a Synapse account can request the dataset by submitting a Data Use Certificate (DUC) at https://help.adknowledgeportal.org/apd/Data-Use-Certificates.2623373330.html; requests are reviewed within approximately 1 week, and approved users may download the data for 12 months under the terms of the DUC. The processed data can also be explored via the Single Cell Portal (https://singlecell.broadinstitute.org/). Bulk mRNA‑seq fastq files and count matrices are publicly available in the Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE299277 (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE299277). All other data are deposited in Dryad, DOI 10.5061/dryad.zcrjdfnn5. External datasets analysed (but not generated) in this work are listed in Supplementary Table 3 with URLs.
