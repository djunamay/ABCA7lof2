        (A) Lipid synthesis and storage pathways perturbed in ABCA7 LoF excitatory neurons vs. control as measured by snRNA-seq on the post-mortem human PFC. Enrichments of biological processes were computed using FGSEA. Red = enrichment > 0, Blue = enrichment < 0. * = $p<0.05$. 
        (B) Schematic model showing anabolic processes feeding from the TCA cycle towards fatty acid (FA) and triglyceride (TG) synthesis. DG = diacylglyceride, PA = phosphatidic acid, PC = phosphatidylcholine, PE = phosphatidylethanolamine, PS = phosphatidylserine. * = differentially expressed in ABCA7 LoF vs. control excitatory neurons from post-mortem human brain at $p<0.05$ and $\log\text{FC}<0$. 
        (C) 𝛽-oxidation and TCA pathways perturbed in ABCA7 LoF excitatory neurons vs. control as measured by snRNA-seq on the post-mortem human PFC. Enrichments of biological processes were computed using FGSEA. Red = enrichment > 0, Blue = enrichment < 0. * = $p<0.05$. 
        (D) Schematic model showing catabolic processes feeding into the TCA cycle and oxidative phosphorylation with key genes from (C) highlighted in red or blue. * = $p<0.05$. For (A, C,) boxes indicate per-condition dataset quartiles, and whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers (i.e., within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the first or third quartile). 
        (E, F) Transcript levels of ACLY (E) and SCP2 (F) assessed in post-mortem human PFC by RNAscope. Transcript counts per SLC17A7+ cell are reported in each bar chart. $N = 8$ individuals per genotype. Per-cell Wilcoxon rank-sum p-values are reported.

        (A) Quantification of neuronal Aβ42 fluorescence intensity. P-values were computed by a linear mixed-effects model on per-NeuN+ volume averages, including well-of-origin as a random effect. $N = 16$ (WT; 2261 cells), $N=8$ (p.Tyr622*; 1466 cells), $N=6$ wells (p.Glu50fs*3; 999 cells) from 4-week-old iNs. Boxes indicate per-condition dataset quartiles, and whiskers extend to the most extreme data points not considered outliers (i.e., within 1.5 times the interquartile range from the first or third quartile). Individual data points represent per-well averages of cell-level intensities. 
        (B) Representative images per condition showing mean-intensity projections of the entire image (NeuN+) and projections within NeuN+ volumes considered for quantification (Aβ42). Representative images for the Aβ42 channel were processed with condition-wide percentile-based background subtraction and thresholding. Representative images of cell soma underwent per-image percentile-based background subtraction and thresholding, reflecting the segmentation methodology.
