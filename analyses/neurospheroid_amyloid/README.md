# Amyloid ELISA on induced Neurons and cortical organoids

## Experiment Description
Culture media were collected and analyzed for Aβ40 and Aβ42 levels using ELISA kits (ThermoFisher Scientific, KHB3481 and KHB3441, respectively) per the manufacturer’s protocols. For 4-week-old iNs, media were flash-frozen before analysis. For cortical organoids (age: 5-6 months; days 176-182), media were analyzed immediately after collection following 3-4 weeks of treatment with 500 µM or 1 mM CDP-choline. 

## Data availability
