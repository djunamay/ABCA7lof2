\begin{itemize}
    \item[\textbf{(A)}] Sanger sequencing chromatogram confirming single nucleotide insertion in ABCA7 exon 3 to introduce a premature termination codon into the isogenic iPSC line ABCA7 p.Glu50fs*3 using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. 
    \item[\textbf{(B)}] Sanger sequencing chromatogram confirming patient single nucleotide polymorphism in ABCA7 exon 15 to introduce a premature termination codon into the isogenic iPSC line ABCA7 p.Tyr622* using CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing. 
    \item[\textbf{(C)}] Normal karyotypes were observed for control, ABCA7 p.Glu50fs*3, and ABCA7 p.Tyr622* isogenic iPSC lines. 
    \item[\textbf{(D)}] iPSCs were plated at low density for NGN2 viral transduction. Expression of NGN2 was driven by doxycycline (DOX) induction with puromycin (PURO) selection, then re-plated to match neuronal densities. Neurons were maintained for 4 weeks (DIV 28) before experimentation (Created with BioRender.com). 
    \item[\textbf{(E)}] Neuronal marker gene expression in 2 and 4-week matured iNs.
