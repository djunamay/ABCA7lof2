\subsubsection*{Referee #2 (Remarks to the Author)}
LOF of ABCA7 increases risk of AD. the studies of its disease mechanisms are mostly done in animal models or in vitro cell models, which greatly limited their relavance to human disease. This study performed single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) on rare ABCA7 loss-of-functon(LOF) carriers as well as an independent group of ABCA7 missense variants from the ROSMAP cohort. The study uncovered convergent neuronal pathways perturbed by ABCA7 variants, including those related to lipid metabolism and mitochondrial dysfunction. Further, robust and comprehensive omics analyses (lipidomics and metabolomics) were conducted to validate these observations using functional cellular assays in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC)-derived neurons. Significantly, the study demonstrated that CDP-choline rescued LOF-induced dysregulation in mitochondrial function, lipid droplets, and amyloid biosynthesis. The mechanistic link between lipid disturbance, mitochondrial dysfunction, and amyloid pathology is novel. The robustness of the conclusions could be strengthened with additional controls.

\textbf{Major comments:}

Figure 1D shows the combined demographics. It’s important to show the diagnosis, Cerad score and Braak scores, and gender distribution, stratified by the ABCA7 genotypes (control and LOF).

\textcolor{blue}{The stratified data are provided in Figure\ref{fig:snRNA_cohort}D,E.}

\textcolor{red}{Do we also have to show this in figure 1D?}

Figure 1B, the numbers of samples for normal (n=180) and LOF (n=5) are not balanced. Increasing the number of LOF cases would strengthen the conclusion.

\textcolor{blue}{While we agree with the reviewer on this, given how rare the LoF cases are, these are the maximum number of ABCA7 LoF cases available in the ROSMAP proteomics dataset.}

Figure 5 needs to be strengthened. The statement of ABCA7 LoF iNs recapitulate AD amyloid pathology is weak in Figure. S9A,B and Figure 5D, ELISA is needed to support the effect of pGlu50fs on Abeta42. If BACE1 is reduced by the mutation (Fig. 5E), the levels of APP-CTF in the cell, and sAPPbeta in the medium should be assessed and quantified biochemically, in addition to IF, to confirm the reduction of enzyme activity.

\textcolor{blue}{We have now performed ELISA on media collected from iNs, confirming significant increases in secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42. Following another reviewer's suggestion, we have also aged neurospheroids derived from p.Glu50fs3 and p.Tyr622 iNs and observed similar increases in secreted Aβ40 and Aβ42 within this system. We now provide these data in figures xx. We agree with the reviewer that our previous claim regarding BACE1 requires additional investigation and is not sufficiently supported by the current data. Given this, and recognizing it falls outside the main scope of our study, we have removed these data from the manuscript.}

Figure 5A: a control line should be included to show the effect of pTyr622 on Lipid droplet. Also lipid staining should also be performed in pGlu50fs neurons, since the major lipidomics data were generated from pGlu50fs, not from pTyr622.

\textcolor{red}{To address this comment, we additionally performed LCMS lipidomics on the p.Tyr622* iNs...}

\textbf{Other comments:}

Figure. S7E, F: a nuclei staining and a merged image should be provided for identification of signals in GLUT neurons.

\textcolor{red}{Can we say we did not have additional brain tissue available and therefore could not perform this experiment and have removed the other data?}

It appears that only one clone is generated for human iPSC carrying ABCA7 variants (related to Fig. 3), it will be more convincing to have one more independent clone or line to replicate the findings for each variant.

\textcolor{blue}{Emphasize that p.Glu and p.Tyr are separate clones?}

\textcolor{red}{What do we say here?}

Figure 4D: The correlation is not convincing, especially due to the combination of two genotypes and the clustering of data points in the LOF line.

\textcolor{blue}{In line with another reviewer’s comments we have now removed this panel.}
