# snRNA-seq cluster analyses

## Data availability

- Where needed, commands to download data are provided at the start of each notebook.
- This subsection is based on outputs from [snRNAseq_processing](analyses/snRNAseq_processing/)

## Code overview

### Requirements:

- Run `./projections.ipynb`.
- Run `./run_partitioning.py` to run METIS and K/L algorithms.
- Run `./benchmarking_graph_partitioning.ipynb` to benchmark clustering and partitioning methods.
- Run `./KL_clusters.ipynb` to visualize graph partitioning results.
