               models to study human brain development offers great promise for
               understanding the nervous system in both healthy individuals and
               patients. In this protocol, we describe how to generate and
               assemble subdomain-specific forebrain spheroids, also known as
               brain region-specific organoids, from human pluripotent stem
               cells (hPSCs). We describe how to pattern the neural spheroids
               toward either a dorsal forebrain or a ventral forebrain fate,
               establishing human cortical spheroids (hCSs) and human
               subpallial spheroids (hSSs), respectively. We also describe how
               to combine the neural spheroids in vitro to assemble forebrain
               assembloids that recapitulate the interactions of glutamatergic
               and GABAergic neurons seen in vivo. Astrocytes are also present
               in the human forebrain-specific spheroids, and these undergo
               maturation when the forebrain spheroids are cultured long term.

               million cells from 283 post-mortem human brain samples across 48
               individuals with and without Alzheimer's disease. We identify 76
               cell types, including region-specific subtypes of astrocytes and
               excitatory neurons and an inhibitory interneuron population
               unique to the thalamus and distinct from canonical inhibitory
               subclasses. We identify vulnerable populations of excitatory and
               inhibitory neurons that are depleted in specific brain regions

               final and proper fatty acids within PC. The reacylation step is
               catalyzed by lysophosphatidylcholine acyltransferase (LPCAT),
               and we report here the identification of a novel LPCAT, which we
               named LPCAT3. LPCAT3 belongs to the membrane-bound
               O-acyltransferase (MBOAT) family and encodes a protein of 487
               amino acids with a calculated molecular mass of 56 kDa.
               Membranes from HEK293 cells overexpressing LPCAT3 showed
               significantly increased LPCAT activity as assessed by thin layer
               chromatography analysis with substrate preference toward
               unsaturated fatty acids. LPCAT3 is localized within the
               endoplasmic reticulum and is primarily expressed in metabolic
               tissues including liver, adipose, and pancreas. In a human
               hepatoma Huh7 cells, RNA interference-mediated knockdown of
               LPCAT3 resulted in virtually complete loss of membrane LPCAT
               activity, suggesting that LPCAT3 is primarily responsible for
               hepatic LPCAT activity. Furthermore, peroxisome
               proliferator-activated receptor alpha agonists dose-dependently
               regulated LPCAT3 in liver in a peroxisome proliferator-activated

               pathogens and particulates out of the respiratory airways.
               Ciliated cells produce ATP that powers cilia beating by densely
               grouping mitochondria just beneath the apical membrane. However,
               this efficient localization comes at a cost because electrons
               leaked during oxidative phosphorylation react with molecular
               oxygen to form superoxide, and thus, the cluster of mitochondria
               creates a hotspot for oxidant production. The relatively high
               oxygen concentration overlying airway epithelia further
               intensifies the risk of generating superoxide. Thus, airway
               ciliated cells face a unique challenge of producing harmful
               levels of oxidants. However, surprisingly, highly ciliated
               epithelia produce less reactive oxygen species (ROS) than
               epithelia with few ciliated cells. Compared to other airway cell
               types, ciliated cells express high levels of mitochondrial
               uncoupling proteins, UCP2 and UCP5. These proteins decrease
               mitochondrial protonmotive force and thereby reduce production
               of ROS. As a result, lipid peroxidation, a marker of oxidant
               injury, decreases. However, mitochondrial uncoupling proteins
               exact a price for decreasing oxidant production; they decrease
               the fraction of mitochondrial respiration that generates ATP.
               These findings indicate that ciliated cells sacrifice
               mitochondrial efficiency in exchange for safety from damaging
               oxidation. Employing uncoupling proteins to prevent oxidant
               production, instead of relying solely on antioxidants to
               decrease postproduction oxidant levels, may offer an advantage
               for targeting a local area of intense ROS generation.",

               The simulations showed that the presence of lipids with highly

              metabolic pathways to sustain physiological activity. Glucose,
              the primary energy substrate, undergoes complex metabolic
              transformations, with mitochondria playing a central role in ATP
              production via oxidative phosphorylation. Dysregulation of this
              metabolic interplay is implicated in Alzheimer's disease (AD),
              where compromised glucose metabolism, oxidative stress, and
              mitochondrial dysfunction contribute to disease progression. This
              review explores the intricate bioenergetic crosstalk between
              astrocytes and neurons, highlighting the function of
              mitochondrial uncoupling proteins (UCPs), particularly UCP4, as
              important regulators of brain metabolism and neuronal function.
              Predominantly expressed in the brain, UCP4 reduces the membrane
              potential in the inner mitochondrial membrane, thereby
              potentially decreasing the generation of reactive oxygen species.
              Furthermore, UCP4 mitigates mitochondrial calcium overload and
              sustains cellular ATP levels through a metabolic shift from
              mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis. Interestingly, the
              levels of the neuronal UCPs, UCP2, 4 and 5 are significantly
              reduced in AD brain tissue and a specific UCP4 variant has been
              associated to an increased risk of developing AD. Few studies
              modulating the expression of UCP4 in astrocytes or neurons have
              highlighted protective effects against neurodegeneration and

              for therapeutic interventions in AD and other neurodegenerative
              diseases. Despite significant advances, our understanding of UCPs
              in brain metabolism remains in its early stages, emphasizing the

               a human cDNA that encoded a distinct CCT isoform, called

               encoding CCTalpha. CCTbeta transcripts were detected in human
               adult and fetal tissues, and very high transcript levels were
               found in placenta and testis. CCTbeta and CCTalpha proteins
               share highly related, but not identical, catalytic domains
               followed by three amphipathic helical repeats. Like CCTalpha,
               CCTbeta required the presence of lipid regulators for maximum
               catalytic activity. The amino terminus of CCTbeta bears no
               resemblance to the amino terminus of CCTalpha, and CCTbeta

               potential phosphorylation sites of the 16 identified in
               CCTalpha. Transfection of COS-7 cells with a CCTbeta expression
               construct led to the overexpression of CCT activity, the

               The fatty acyl chain composition of phospholipids determines the
               biophysical properties of membranes and thereby affects their
               impact on biological processes. The composition of fatty acyl
               chains is also actively regulated through a deacylation and
               reacylation pathway called Lands' cycle. Recent studies of mouse
               genetic models have demonstrated that lysophosphatidylcholine
               acyltransferases (LPCATs), which catalyze the incorporation of
               fatty acyl chains into the sn-2 site of phosphatidylcholine,
               play important roles in pathophysiology. Two LPCAT family
               members, LPCAT1 and LPCAT3, have been particularly well studied.
               LPCAT1 is crucial for proper lung function due to its role in

               lipid homeostasis by regulating lipid absorption in intestine,

               Mounting evidence also suggests that changes in LPCAT activity

              Genome-wide association studies have indicated that ABCA7 single

              however, the role that ABCA7 plays in the brain in the AD context

              (A7(-/-)) mice with J20 amyloidogenic mice to address this issue.
              We show that ABCA7 loss doubled insoluble A$\beta$ levels and

  abstract  = "A major rate-limiting step for A$\beta$ generation and
               deposition in Alzheimer's disease brains is BACE1-mediated
               cleavage ($\beta$-cleavage) of the amyloid precursor protein
               (APP). We previously reported that APP undergoes palmitoylation
               at two cysteine residues (Cys186 and Cys187) in the
               E1-ectodomain. 8--10\% of total APP is palmitoylated in vitro
               and in vivo. Palmitoylated APP (palAPP) shows greater preference
               for $\beta$-cleavage than total APP in detergent resistant lipid
               rafts. Protein palmitoylation is known to promote protein
               dimerization. Since dimerization of APP at its E1-ectodomain
               results in elevated BACE1-mediated cleavage of APP, we have now
               investigated whether palmitoylation of APP affects its
               dimerization and whether this leads to elevated $\beta$-cleavage
               of the protein. Here we report that over 90\% of palAPP is
               dimerized while only ~20\% of total APP forms dimers.
               PalAPP-dimers are predominantly cis-oriented while total APP
               dimerizes in both cis- and trans-orientation. PalAPP forms
               dimers 4.5-times more efficiently than total APP. Overexpression
               of the palmitoylating enzymes DHHC7 and DHHC21 that increase
               palAPP levels and A$\beta$ release, also increased APP
               dimerization in cells. Conversely, inhibition of APP
               palmitoylation by pharmacological inhibitors reduced
               APP-dimerization in coimmunoprecipitation and FLIM/FRET assays.
               Finally, in vitro BACE1-activity assays demonstrate that
               palmitoylation-dependent dimerization of APP promotes
               $\beta$-cleavage of APP in lipid-rich detergent resistant cell
               membranes (DRMs), when compared to total APP. Most importantly,
               generation of sAPP$\beta$-sAPP$\beta$ dimers is dependent on
               APP-palmitoylation while total sAPP$\beta$ generation is not.
               Since BACE1 shows preference for palAPP dimers over total APP,
               palAPP dimers may serve as novel targets for effective
               $\beta$-cleavage inhibitors of APP as opposed to BACE1
               inhibitors.",

               neuromodulators, and structural components. Neuronal glucose
               oxidation exceeds that in astrocytes, but both rates increase in
               direct proportion to excitatory neurotransmission; signaling and

              the combined occurrence of extracellular $\beta$-amyloid plaques
              and intracellular neurofibrillary tangles in the brain. While
              plaques contain aggregated forms of the amyloid $\beta$-peptide
              (A$\beta$), tangles are formed by fibrillar forms of the
              microtubule associated protein tau. All mutations identified so
              far to cause familial forms of early onset AD (FAD) are localized
              close to or within the A$\beta$ domain of the amyloid precursor
              protein (APP) or in the presenilin proteins that are essential
              components of a protease complex involved in the generation of
              A$\beta$. Mutations in the tau gene are not associated with FAD,
              but can cause other forms of dementia. The genetics of FAD
              together with biochemical and cell biological data, led to the
              formulation of the amyloid hypothesis, stating that accumulation
              and aggregation of A$\beta$ is the primary event in the
              pathogenesis of AD, while tau might mediate its toxicity and
              neurodegeneration.The generation of A$\beta$ involves sequential
              proteolytic cleavages of the amyloid precursor protein (APP) by
              enzymes called $\beta$-and $\gamma$-secretases. Notably, APP
              itself as well as the secretases are integral membrane proteins.
              Thus, it is very likely that membrane lipids are involved in the
              regulation of subcellular transport, activity, and metabolism of
              AD related proteins.Indeed, several studies indicate that
              membrane lipids, including cholesterol and sphingolipids (SLs)
              affect A$\beta$ generation and aggregation. Interestingly, APP
              and other AD associated proteins, including $\beta$-and
              $\gamma$-secretases can, in turn, influence lipid metabolic
              pathways. Here, we review the close connection of cellular lipid
              metabolism and AD associated proteins and discuss potential

              and senescence. However, it is not clear how DSB-bearing neurons
              influence neuroinflammation associated with neurodegeneration.
              Here, we characterize DSB-bearing neurons from the CK-p25 mouse
              model of neurodegeneration using single-nucleus, bulk, and
              spatial transcriptomic techniques. DSB-bearing neurons enter a
              late-stage DNA damage response marked by nuclear factor $\kappa$B
              (NF$\kappa$B)-activated senescent and antiviral immune pathways.
              In humans, Alzheimer's disease pathology is closely associated
              with immune activation in excitatory neurons. Spatial
              transcriptomics reveal that regions of CK-p25 brain tissue dense
              with DSB-bearing neurons harbor signatures of inflammatory
              microglia, which is ameliorated by NF$\kappa$B knockdown in
              neurons. Inhibition of NF$\kappa$B in DSB-bearing neurons also
              reduces microglia activation in organotypic mouse brain slice
              culture. In conclusion, DSBs activate immune pathways in neurons,
              which in turn adopt a senescence-associated secretory phenotype
              to elicit microglia activation. These findings highlight a

              is most similar in primary structure to ABCA1, the protein that
              mediates cell lipid efflux and formation of high-density
              lipoprotein (HDL). Lipid metabolic labeling/tracer efflux assays
              were employed to investigate lipid efflux in BHK-ABCA7(low

              Shotgun lipid mass spectrometry was used to determine lipid
              composition of HDL synthesized by BHK-ABCA7 and BHK-ABCA1 cells.
              BHK-ABCA7(low) cells exhibited significant efflux only of
              choline-phospholipid and phosphatidylinositol. BHK-ABCA7(high)

              phosphatidylserine and phosphatidylethanolamine in BHK cells) and
              phosphatidylinositol to apo A-I. In efflux assays to apo A-I,
              after adjustment to choline-phospholipid, ABCA7-mediated efflux
              removed ~4 times more serine-lipid and phosphatidylinositol than
              ABCA1-mediated efflux, while ABCA1-mediated efflux removed ~3
              times more cholesterol than ABCA7-mediated efflux. Shotgun
              lipidomic analysis revealed that ABCA7-HDL had ~20 mol\% less
              phosphatidylcholine and 3-5 times more serine-lipid and
              phosphatidylinositol than ABCA1-HDL, while ABCA1-HDL contained
              only ~6 mol\% (or ~1.1 times) more cholesterol than ABCA7-HDL.
              The discrepancy between the tracer efflux assays and shotgun
              lipidomics with respect to cholesterol may be explained by an
              underestimate of ABCA7-mediated cholesterol efflux in the former

              beta-amyloid protein and its ability to promote degeneration in
              vitro has been previously suggested. To evaluate this hypothesis
              and to define a structure-activity relationship for beta-amyloid,
              aggregation properties of an overlapping series of synthetic
              beta-amyloid peptides (beta APs) were investigated and compared
              with beta AP neurotoxic properties in vitro. Using light
              microscopy, electrophoresis, and ultracentrifugation assays, we
              found that few beta APs assembled into aggregates immediately
              after solubilization, but that over time peptides containing the
              highly hydrophobic beta 29-35 region formed stable aggregations.
              In short-term neuronal cultures, toxicity was associated
              specifically with those beta APs that also exhibited significant
              aggregation. Further, upon the partial reversal of beta 1-42
              aggregation, a concomitant loss of toxicity was observed. A
              synthetic peptide derived from a different amyloidogenic protein,
              islet amyloid polypeptide, exhibited aggregation but not
              toxicity, suggesting that beta AP-induced neurotoxicity in vitro
              is not a nonspecific reaction to aggregated protein. The
              correlation between beta AP aggregation and neurotoxicity was
              also observed in long-term neuronal cultures but not in astrocyte
              cultures. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that
              beta-amyloid protein contributes to neurodegeneration in
              Alzheimer's disease.",

              with profound shifts in metabolic energy, especially in the
              colon, which exists in an energetically depleting state of
              physiological hypoxia. However, studies that systematically
              examine energy flux and adenylate metabolism during intestinal
              epithelial barrier development and restoration after disruption
              are lacking. Here, to delineate barrier-related energy flux, we
              developed an HPLC-based profiling method to track changes in
              energy flux and adenylate metabolites during barrier development
              and restoration. Cultured epithelia exhibited pooling of
              phosphocreatine and maintained ATP during barrier development.
              EDTA-induced epithelial barrier disruption revealed that
              hypoxanthine levels correlated with barrier resistance. Further
              studies uncovered that hypoxanthine supplementation improves
              barrier function and wound healing and that hypoxanthine appears
              to do so by increasing intracellular ATP, which improved
              cytoskeletal G- to F-actin polymerization. Hypoxanthine
              supplementation increased the adenylate energy charge in the
              murine colon, indicating potential to regulate adenylate energy
              charge-mediated metabolism in intestinal epithelial cells.
              Moreover, experiments in a murine colitis model disclosed that
              hypoxanthine loss during active inflammation correlates with
              markers of disease severity. In summary, our results indicate
              that hypoxanthine modulates energy metabolism in intestinal

              superoxide anion is the main undesired by-product of
              mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. Its production is
              triggered by a leak of electrons from the mitochondrial

              testing, prevention, and treatment. OBJECTIVE: To identify
              genetic loci associated with late-onset Alzheimer disease in
              African Americans. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The
              Alzheimer Disease Genetics Consortium (ADGC) assembled multiple
              data sets representing a total of 5896 African Americans (1968
              case participants, 3928 control participants) 60 years or older
              that were collected between 1989 and 2011 at multiple sites. The
              association of Alzheimer disease with genotyped and imputed
              single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) was assessed in
              case-control and in family-based data sets. Results from
              individual data sets were combined to perform an inverse
              variance-weighted meta-analysis, first with genome-wide analyses
              and subsequently with gene-based tests for previously reported
              loci. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Presence of Alzheimer disease
              according to standardized criteria. RESULTS: Genome-wide
              significance in fully adjusted models (sex, age, APOE genotype,
              population stratification) was observed for a SNP in ABCA7
              (rs115550680, allele = G; frequency, 0.09 cases and 0.06

              $\times$ 10(-9)), which is in linkage disequilibrium with SNPs
              previously associated with Alzheimer disease in Europeans (0.8 <
              D' < 0.9). The effect size for the SNP in ABCA7 was comparable
              with that of the APOE ϵ4-determining SNP rs429358 (allele = C;
              frequency, 0.30 cases and 0.18 controls; OR, 2.31 [95\% CI,

              associated with Alzheimer disease but not reaching significance
              in genome-wide analyses were replicated in gene-based analyses
              accounting for linkage disequilibrium between markers and
              correcting for number of tests performed per gene (CR1, BIN1,
              EPHA1, CD33; 0.0005 < empirical P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND
              RELEVANCE: In this meta-analysis of data from African American
              participants, Alzheimer disease was significantly associated with
              variants in ABCA7 and with other genes that have been associated
              with Alzheimer disease in individuals of European ancestry.

               dysfunction. Mitochondrial dysfunction due to a relative lack of
               micronutrients and substrates is implicated in the development
               of many chronic diseases. l-carnitine is one of the key
               nutrients for proper mitochondrial function and is notable for
               its role in fatty acid oxidation. l-carnitine also plays a major
               part in protecting cellular membranes, preventing fatty acid
               accumulation, modulating ketogenesis and glucogenesis and in the
               elimination of toxic metabolites. l-carnitine deficiency has
               been observed in many diseases including organic acidurias,
               inborn errors of metabolism, endocrine imbalances, liver and
               kidney disease. The protective effects of micronutrients
               targeting mitochondria hold considerable promise for the
               management of age and metabolic related diseases. Preventing
               nutrient deficiencies like l-carnitine can be beneficial in
               maintaining metabolic flexibility via the optimization of
               mitochondrial function. This paper reviews the critical role of
               l-carnitine in mitochondrial function, metabolic flexibility and
               in other pathophysiological cellular mechanisms.",

              variation in the dietary requirement for choline that can be
              explained by common genetic polymorphisms. Because of its
              wide-ranging roles in human metabolism, from cell structure to

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The Alzheimer's disease (AD) risk gene ABCA7 has
              suggested functions in lipid metabolism and the immune system.
              Rare premature termination codon (PTC) mutations and an expansion
              of a variable number of tandem repeats (VNTR) polymorphism in the
              gene, both likely cause a lower ABCA7 expression and hereby
              increased risk for AD. However, the exact mechanism of action
              remains unclear. By studying CSF biomarkers reflecting different
              types of AD-related pathological processes, we aim to get a
              better insight in those processes and establish a biomarker
              profile of mutation carriers. METHODS: The study population
              consisted of 229 AD patients for whom CSF was available and ABCA7
              sequencing and VNTR genotyping had been performed. This included
              28 PTC mutation and 16 pathogenic expansion carriers. CSF levels
              of A$\beta$, A$\beta$, P-tau, T-tau, sAPP$\alpha$, sAPP$\beta$,
              YKL-40, and hFABP were determined using ELISA and Meso Scale
              Discovery assays. We compared differences in levels of these
              biomarkers and the A$\beta$ ratio between AD patients with or
              without an ABCA7 PTC mutation or expansion using linear
              regression on INT-transformed data with APOE-status, age and sex
              as covariates. RESULTS: Carriers of ABCA7 expansion mutations had
              significantly lower A$\beta$ levels (P = 0.022) compared with
              non-carrier patients. The effect of the presence of ABCA7
              mutations on CSF levels was especially pronounced in APOE
              $\epsilon$4-negative carriers. In addition, VNTR expansion
              carriers had reduced A$\beta$ (P = 0.023), sAPP$\alpha$ (P =
              0.047), sAPP$\beta$ (P = 0.016), and YKL-40 (P = 0.0036) levels.
              CONCLUSIONS: Our results are suggestive for an effect on APP
              processing by repeat expansions given the changes in the
              amyloid-related CSF biomarkers that were found in carriers. The
              decrease in YKL-40 levels in expansion carriers moreover suggests
              that these patients potentially have a reduced inflammatory
              response to AD damage. Moreover, our findings suggest the
              existence of a mechanism, independent of lowered expression,
              affecting neuropathology in expansion carriers.",

               proton transporters of the mitochondrial carrier superfamily
               and/or membrane lipids. Some mitochondrial proton transporters,
               such as uncoupling proteins (UCPs), transport protons as their
               general regulating function; while others are symporters or
               antiporters, which use the proton gradient as a driving force to
               co-transport other substrates across the mitochondrial inner
               membrane (such as phosphate carrier, a symporter; or

              evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and human-based studies has

              one of the most important risk genes of both early-onset and
              late-onset AD, harboring both common and rare risk variants with
              relatively large effect on AD risk. Within this review, we
              provide a comprehensive assessment of the literature on ABCA7,
              with a focus on AD-related human -omics studies (e.g. genomics,

              American populations, indirect ABCA7 GWAS associations are

              patients, and some of these have displayed inheritance patterns
              resembling autosomal dominant AD. In addition, rare missense
              variants are more frequent in AD patients than healthy controls,
              whereas a common ABCA7 missense variant may protect from disease.
              Methylation at several CpG sites in the ABCA7 locus is
              significantly associated with AD. Furthermore, ABCA7 contains
              many different isoforms and ABCA7 splicing has been shown to

              significant correlations with AD endophenotypes; in particular
              amyloid deposition and brain morphology. In conclusion,
              human-based -omics studies provide converging evidence of
              (partial) ABCA7 loss as an AD pathomechanism, and future studies

              activation during ischemia (and during reperfusion in the course
              of treating ischemia) are not known. METHODS AND RESULTS: To
              investigate the NF-kappaB activation induced during oxidative
              stress, we examined human cardiac tissue obtained during surgical
              procedures requiring cardiopulmonary bypass. In vitro, we
              examined human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) exposed
              to hypoxia, reoxygenation after hypoxia, or a reactive oxygen
              intermediate (H(2)O(2)). Electrophoretic mobility shift assays
              performed on right atrial tissue revealed prominent NF-kappaB
              activation after hearts had been exposed to ischemia and
              reperfusion. The assays also showed that NF-kappaB activation was
              observed in hypoxic HUVECs after reoxygenation and in cultures
              treated with H(2)O(2) (500 micromol/L). Pervanadate (200
              micromol/L) also induced marked NF-kappaB activation in HUVECs,
              indicating that H(2)O(2)-induced NF-kappaB activation is
              potentiated by the inhibition of tyrosine phosphatases. Western
              blotting of cytoplasmic IkappaBalpha demonstrated that NF-kappaB
              activation induced by oxidative stress was not associated with
              IkappaBalpha degradation. In contrast, tumor necrosis
              factor-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation occurred in concert
              with degradation of IkappaBalpha. Inhibition of IkappaBalpha
              degradation with a proteasome inhibitor, MG-115, blocked
              NF-kappaB activation induced by tumor necrosis factor-alpha;
              however, MG-115 had no effect on NF-kappaB activation during
              oxidative stress. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated a

               The strongest disease-associated changes appeared early in

              vector indicated some differences in regulation of their

              increased ABCA1-GFP and the release of cholesterol and
              phospholipid in 293/2c but increased neither ABCA7-GFP nor the

              phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in 293/2c cells. In

              Despite these different responses to PMA, all of the effects of
              PMA were reversed by a specific protein kinase C inhibitor
              G{\"o}6976, suggesting that the changes were in fact due to

               This microiontophoretic study was carried out on single
               cholinoceptive neurons of the somatosensory cortex in the rat in
               order to analyze the effects of L- and D-carnitine and

               clearly potentiated the cholinergic excitatory responses. On the

              ABCA7 and its transport substrates remain unclear.
              Immunohistochemical analyses of human brain sections from AD and
              non-AD subjects revealed that ABCA7 is expressed in neuron and
              microglia cells in the cerebral cortex. The transport substrates
              and acceptors were identified in BHK/ABCA7 cells and compared
              with those of ABCA1. Like ABCA1, ABCA7 exported choline
              phospholipids in the presence of apoA-I and apoE; however, unlike
              ABCA1, cholesterol efflux was marginal. Lipid efflux by ABCA7 was
              saturated by 5$\mu$g/ml apoA-I and was not dependent on apoE
              isoforms, whereas efflux by ABCA1 was dependent on apoA-I up to

              ABCA7. These results suggest that lysoPC is one of the major

              roles for Drosophila orthologs of AD risk genes in lipid droplet
              formation that, when disrupted, lead to neurodegeneration. Our
              work reinforces a critical role for the sequestration of
              peroxidated lipids in glia, and places Apolipoprotein E
              $\epsilon$4 (APOE4) with other AD risk factors in the transfer
              process of lipids from neurons to glia to form lipid droplets. ,
              A growing list of Alzheimer's disease (AD) genetic risk factors
              is being identified, but the contribution of each variant to
              disease mechanism remains largely unknown. We have previously
              shown that elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS)
              induces lipid synthesis in neurons leading to the sequestration
              of peroxidated lipids in glial lipid droplets (LD), delaying
              neurotoxicity. This neuron-to-glia lipid transport is
              APOD/E-dependent. To identify proteins that modulate these
              neuroprotective effects, we tested the role of AD risk genes in
              ROS-induced LD formation and demonstrate that several genes
              impact neuroprotective LD formation, including homologs of human
              ABCA1 , ABCA7 , VLDLR , VPS26 , VPS35 , AP2A , PICALM , and CD2AP
              . Our data also show that ROS enhances A$\beta$42 phenotypes in
              flies and mice. Finally, a peptide agonist of ABCA1 restores
              glial LD formation in a humanized APOE4 fly model, highlighting a
              potentially therapeutic avenue to prevent ROS-induced
              neurotoxicity. This study places many AD genetic risk factors in
              a ROS-induced neuron-to-glia lipid transfer pathway with a
              critical role in protecting against neurotoxicity.",

               age-related neurodegenerative diseases and accounts for the
               majority of dementia cases worldwide. Tremendous ongoing efforts
               of basic and clinical research have expanded our knowledge on AD
               and its complex multifactorial pathogenesis. For sporadic AD, it
               is widely assumed that silent and early symptomatic stages
               initiate decades before the irreversible decline in cognitive
               abilities that ultimately lead to debilitating conditions. In
               addition to amyloid plaques and tau-containing neurofibrillary
               tangles as the most prominent hallmarks of AD lesions within the
               affected brain areas, we now possess a broader collection of
               pathological signatures that are associated with AD development
               and progression. In this regard, there is a substantial body of
               evidence suggesting that hypometabolism occurs in the brains of
               individuals at the prodromal stage before dementia is diagnosed,
               which may reflect an early role of metabolic dysfunction in AD.
               This perspective surveys the vast literature and critically

              Homeostasis",
  author   = "Giralt, Marta and Villarroya, Francesc",
  abstract = "Introduction: Mitochondrial uncoupling is a physiological process
              that has direct and indirect consequences on glucose homeostasis.
              Non-shivering thermogenesis in brown adipose tissue, which is the
              most well-recognized biological process related to the
              physiological uncoupling of mitochondria, is caused by uncoupling
              protein-1 (UCP1), which mediates a regulated permeabilization of
              the mitochondrial inner membrane to protons. Conclusion: The
              uncoupled brown fat mitochondria are specialized to produce heat
              by oxidizing large amounts of substrates, making brown fat a sink
              that can actively drain glucose from circulation. This has been
              confirmed in human studies in which active brown fat was detected
              by glucose-derivative-based positron emission tomography scans.
              Thus, UCP1-mediated activation of brown fat appears to be a
              likely mechanism through which hyperglycemia could be
              ameliorated. In other tissues, mitochondria are reported to be
              mildly uncoupled by the UCP1-like proteins, UCP2 and UCP3. The
              primary role of these other UCPs does not appear to be the
              oxidation of a metabolic substrate (e.g., glucose) for heat
              production; instead, they participate in other processes, such as
              regulating the production of reactive oxygen species and
              transporting certain metabolites across the mitochondrial
              membrane. UCP2 activity influences glucose homeostasis by fine
              tuning intracellular events related to the cellular energy
              status, thereby controlling insulin secretion, food intake
              behavior and adiponectin secretion in pancreatic $\beta$ - cells,
              brain and white adipose tissue, respectively. UCP3 appears to be
              more specifically involved in promoting fatty acid oxidation in
              muscle, and is thus likely to influence glucose metabolism
              indirectly. Several genetic association studies have related
              polymorphisms in the genes encoding UCPs with obesity and/or type
              2 diabetes phenotypes. In this review, we will focus on what is
              known about the specific role of mitochondrial uncoupling in
              glucose metabolism, and its implications in diabetes.",

              the most abundant phospholipids in all mammalian cell membranes.
              In the 1950s, Eugene Kennedy and co-workers performed
              groundbreaking research that established the general outline of
              many of the pathways of phospholipid biosynthesis. In recent
              years, the importance of phospholipid metabolism in regulating
              lipid, lipoprotein and whole-body energy metabolism has been
              demonstrated in numerous dietary studies and knockout animal
              models. The purpose of this review is to highlight the
              unappreciated impact of phospholipid metabolism on health and
              disease. Abnormally high, and abnormally low, cellular PC/PE
              molar ratios in various tissues can influence energy metabolism
              and have been linked to disease progression. For example,
              inhibition of hepatic PC synthesis impairs very low density
              lipoprotein secretion and changes in hepatic phospholipid
              composition have been linked to fatty liver disease and impaired
              liver regeneration after surgery. The relative abundance of PC
              and PE regulates the size and dynamics of lipid droplets. In
              mitochondria, changes in the PC/PE molar ratio affect energy
              production. We highlight data showing that changes in the PC
              and/or PE content of various tissues are implicated in metabolic

              in the brain, where it acts as a neuromodulator of glutamatergic
              synapses by activating presynaptic metabotropic glutamate
              receptor 3 (mGluR3). Recent data suggest that NAAG is selectively
              localized to postsynaptic dendrites in glutamatergic synapses and
              that it works as a retrograde neurotransmitter. NAAG is released
              in response to glutamate and provides the postsynaptic neuron
              with a feedback mechanisms to inhibit excessive glutamate
              signaling. A key regulator of synaptically available NAAG is
              rapid degradation by the extracellular enzyme glutamate
              carboxypeptidase II (GCPII). Increasing endogenous NAAG-for
              instance by inhibiting GCPII-is a promising treatment option for
              many brain disorders where glutamatergic excitotoxicity plays a
              role. The main effect of NAAG occurs through increased mGluR3
              activation and thereby reduced glutamate release. In the present

               perspective on mitochondrial glutamine metabolism, offering

               bioenergetic roles of glutamine based on the
               compartmentalization of glutamine metabolism to explain why
               cells exhibit metabolic reliance on glutamine. Additionally, we
               examined whether glutamine derivatives contribute to epigenetic
               regulation associated with tumorigenesis. In addition, in
               discussing glutamine transporters, we propose a metabolic target
               for therapeutic intervention in cancer. Insights into how the
               amino acid glutamine powers cellular metabolism could pave the
               way for effective therapeutic strategies for `starving' tumor
               cells. Healthy cells can manufacture enough glutamine to sustain
               normal function, but cancerous growth creates heavier demand for
               this important molecule. Jung Min Han and colleagues at Yonsei
               University in Incheon, South Korea have reviewed the various
               cellular functions of glutamine, and discuss opportunities to
               cut off supply and thereby derail tumor proliferation. Glutamine
               serves as a building block both for amino acids and nucleic
               acids, and is also consumed during mitochondrial energy
               production. Several groups are exploring the feasibility of
               inactivating glutamine synthesis or halting cellular uptake of
               this amino acid as a means of depriving cancer cells of
               nutrients. A deeper understanding of glutamine's metabolic

              inhibition of lipolysis, lipophagy, or both resulted in similar
              overall LD content but dramatic differences in LD morphology.
              Inhibition of the lipolysis enzyme adipose triglyceride lipase

              inhibition caused the accumulation of numerous small LDs within

              inhibition of ATGL and LAL resulted in large LDs, suggesting that

              with this, ATGL was enriched in larger-sized LDs, whereas

  abstract = "L-Carnitine is an essential co-factor in the metabolism of lipids
              and consequently in the production of cellular energy. This
              molecule has important physiological roles, including its
              involvement in the beta-oxidation of fatty acids by facilitating
              the transport of long-chain fatty acids across the mitochondrial
              inner membrane as acylcarnitine esters. In the brain, L-carnitine
              and acetyl-L-carnitine have important roles in cerebral
              bioenergetics and in neuroprotection through a variety of
              mechanisms including their antioxidant properties and in the
              modulation and promotion of synaptic neurotransmission, most
              notably cholinergic neurotransmission. Acetyl-L-carnitine was
              successfully applied as pharmacological agents for treatment of
              chronic degenerative diseases of the senile brain and for slowing
              down the progression of mental deterioration in Alzheimer's
              disease, and they may involve both the cholinergic neuronal
              transmission activity of acetyl-L-carnitine and its ability to
              enhance neuronal metabolism in mitochondria. Astrocytes are able
              to produce large amounts of ketone bodies, which are thought to
              supply adjacent neurons with easily transferable substrates for
              generation of energy. Thus, the L-carnitine uptake mechanism
              becomes the rate-limiting step for astrocyte ketogenesis. Several
              carnitine transporters have been known to be present in
              peripheral tissues. In this review, the functional expression and
              physiological role of carnitine transporters in central nervous
              system is further discussed.",

  abstract = "Genetic discoveries of Alzheimer's disease are the drivers of our

              can contribute towards planning of feasible and efficient
              preventive and curative clinical trials. We first perform a large

              datasets and by-proxy study results (discovery n = 409,435 and
              validation size n = 58,190). Here, we add six variants associated
              with Alzheimer's disease risk (near APP, CHRNE, PRKD3/NDUFAF7,
              PLCG2 and two exonic variants in the SHARPIN gene). Assessment of
              the polygenic risk score and stratifying by APOE reveal a 4 to
              5.5 years difference in median age at onset of Alzheimer's
              disease patients in APOE ɛ4 carriers. Because of this study, the

              Based on a high degree of sequence homology between ABCA1 and

              possibility that ABCA7 might be involved in apolipoprotein

              HEK293 cells overexpressing ABCA7 showed specific binding and
              cross-linking of lipid-poor apoA-I. ABCA7 expression increased
              cellular phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin efflux to apoA-I
              in a manner similar to ABCA1 but had no effect on cholesterol

              the ability to bind apolipoproteins and promote efflux of
              cellular phospholipids without cholesterol, and they suggest a

              the biological function of APOE, APOE4 significantly altered
              signalling pathways associated with cholesterol homeostasis and
              transport. Confirming these findings with histological and

               investigate the detailed bioenergetics of the in situ
               mitochondria, a method is described to monitor continuously the
               respiration of primary cerebellar granule neuron cultures while
               simultaneously imaging cytoplasmic Ca2+ and mitochondrial
               membrane potential. Coverslip-attached cells were perfused in an
               imaging chamber with upstream and downstream flow-through oxygen
               electrodes. The bioenergetic consequences of chronic glutamate
               exposure were investigated, including ATP supply and demand,
               proton leak, and mitochondrial respiratory capacity during
               chronic glutamate exposure. In 25 mm K+ medium supplemented with
               10\% dialyzed serum, cells utilized 54\% of their respiratory
               capacity in the absence of receptor activation (37\% for ATP
               generation, 12\% to drive the mitochondrial proton leak, and the
               residual 5\% was nonmitochondrial). glutamate initially
               increased mitochondrial respiration from 51 to 68\% of capacity,
               followed by a slow decline. It was estimated that 85\% of this
               increased respiration was because of increased ATP demand,
               whereas 15\% was attributable to a transient mitochondrial
               proton leak. N-Methyl-d-aspartate receptor activation was only
               responsible for 62\% of the increased respiration. When adjusted
               for cell death over 3 h of glutamate exposure, respiration of
               the viable cells remained near basal and protonophore stimulated
               respiration to the same extent as control cells.
               Pyruvate-supplemented media protected cells from glutamate
               excitotoxicity, although this was associated with mitochondrial
               dysfunction. We conclude that excitotoxicity under these
               conditions is not because of an ATP deficit or uncoupling.

               during cold stress and dissipates mitochondrial proton motive
               force generated by the electron transport chain to generate

              100,000 unique proteins have been determined, but this represents
              a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences.
              Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of
              painstaking effort required to determine a single protein
              structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to

              problem'-has been an important open research problem for more

              studies have revealed that ABCA7 is strongly associated with AD.
              In vitro evidence suggests that the role of ABCA7 is related to
              phagocytic activity. Deletion of ABCA7 in a mouse model of AD
              exacerbates cerebral amyloid-$\beta$ plaque load. However, the

              that ABCA7 plays a protective role in the brain that is related
              to phagocytic clearance of amyloid-$\beta$. We isolated microglia
              and macrophages from Abca7-/- and wild type mice and tested them

              results, in vivo phagocytic clearance of amyloid-$\beta$
              oligomers in the hippocampus was reduced in Abca7-/- mice.
              Furthermore, ABCA7 transcription was upregulated in AD brains and
              in amyloidogenic mouse brains specifically in the hippocampus as
              a response to the amyloid-$\beta$ pathogenic state. Together
              these results indicate that ABCA7 mediates phagocytic clearance

              population-based heritability and polygenic association study of
              Alzheimer's disease was conducted between 1986 and 2016 and is
              the first study to incorporate polygenic risk scores into
              biometrical twin models of Alzheimer's disease. The sample
              included 1586 twins drawn from the Swedish Twin Registry which
              were nested within 1137 twin pairs (449 complete pairs and 688
              incomplete pairs) with clinically based diagnoses and registry

              controls). We report contributions of polygenic risk scores at <
              1 $\times$ 10, considering a full polygenic risk score (PRS), PRS
              without the region (PRS.no.APOE) and PRS.no.APOE plus directly
              measured alleles. Biometric twin models estimated the
              contribution of environmental influences and measured (PRS) and
              unmeasured genes to Alzheimer's disease risk. The full PRS and
              PRS.no.APOE contributed 10.1 and 2.4\% to Alzheimer's disease
              risk, respectively. When ɛ4 alleles were added to the model with
              the PRS.no.APOE, the total contribution was 11.4\% to Alzheimer's
              disease risk, where ɛ4 explained 9.3\% and PRS.no.APOE dropped
              from 2.4 to 2.1\%. The total genetic contribution to Alzheimer's
              disease risk, measured and unmeasured, was 71\% while
              environmental influences unique to each twin accounted for 29\%
              of the risk. The region accounts for much of the measurable
              genetic contribution to Alzheimer's disease, with a smaller
              contribution from other measured polygenic influences.
              Importantly, substantial background genetic influences remain to
              be understood.",

               preserving healthy mitochondrial functions and activities.
               Preclinical and clinical studies have shown that impaired
               mitophagy negatively affects cellular health and contributes to
               age-related chronic diseases. Strategies to boost mitophagy have
               been successfully tested in model organisms, and, recently, some
               have been translated into clinics. In this Review, we describe
               the basic mechanisms of mitophagy and how mitophagy can be
               assessed in human blood, the immune system and tissues,

               modulating immune responses. Because the immune system and lipid
               metabolism causatively engage in the pathogenesis of AD, we
               investigated how ABCA7 haplodeficiency modulates the metabolic
               profile in mouse brains during acute immune response using a
               metabolomics approach through LC/Q-TOF-MS. Peripheral

              genome-wide association studies only explain part of the
              heritability of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Epistasis has been
              considered as one of the main causes of ``missing heritability''
              in AD. METHODS: We performed genome-wide epistasis screening (N =
              10,389) for the clinical diagnosis of AD using three popularly
              adopted methods. Subsequent analyses were performed to eliminate
              spurious associations caused by possible confounding factors.
              Then, candidate genetic interactions were examined for their
              co-expression in the brains of AD patients and analyzed for their
              association with intermediate AD phenotypes. Moreover, a new
              approach was developed to compile the epistasis risk factors into
              an epistasis risk score (ERS) based on multifactor dimensional
              reduction. Two independent datasets were used to evaluate the
              feasibility of ERSs in AD risk prediction. RESULTS: We identified
              2 candidate genetic interactions with P < 0.05 (RAMP3-SEMA3A and
              NSMCE1-DGKE/C17orf67) and another 5 genetic interactions with P <
              0.1. Co-expression between the identified interactions supported
              the existence of possible biological interactions underlying the
              observed statistical significance. Further association of
              candidate interactions with intermediate phenotypes helps explain
              the mechanisms of neuropathological alterations involved in AD.
              Importantly, we found that ERSs can identify high-risk
              individuals showing earlier onset of AD. Combined risk scores of
              SNPs and SNP-SNP interactions showed slightly but steadily
              increased AUC in predicting the clinical status of AD.
              CONCLUSIONS: In summary, we performed a genome-wide epistasis
              analysis to identify novel genetic interactions potentially
              implicated in AD. We found that ERS can serve as an indicator of
              the genetic risk of AD.",

              amyloid precursor protein (APP) processing and generation of
              amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$). Suppression of endogenous ABCA7 in
              several different cell lines resulted in increased
              $\beta$-secretase cleavage and elevated A$\beta$. ABCA7 knock-out
              mice displayed an increased production of endogenous murine
              amyloid A$\beta$42 species. Crossing ABCA7-deficient animals to
              an APP transgenic model resulted in significant increases in the
              soluble A$\beta$ as compared with mice expressing normal levels
              of ABCA7. Only modest changes in the amount of insoluble A$\beta$

              pathology was well developed, whereas A$\beta$ deposition was
              enhanced in younger animals. In vitro studies indicated a more

              age 68,8 years) received three-month therapy with cereton in a
              dose of 1200 mg/day in 3 divided doses. Fifteen patients received
              the same treatment again within 1 year. Immediate and delayed
              (7-9 months after treatment) effects of therapy, including those
              dependent on the ApoE genotype were assessed with a
              neuropsychological test battery. RESULTS: Psychometric measures
              showed a significant improvement after treatment with cereton.
              ApoE4 allele noncarriers performed better on tests of immediate
              and delayed reproduction of 10 words. Although, most indicators
              achieved in the end of therapy course decreased 7-9 months after
              treatment, the level of patients cognitive functioning remained
              at a higher level than before treatment. A repeated course of
              cereton treatment prevents cognitive deficit increasing during
              the follow-up period (10-12 months). CONCLUSION: The drug is
              well-tolerated and safe and can be recommended for preventive
              treatment of dementia in patients with high AD risk, in
              particular in elderly patients with aMCI syndrome.",

              and quantitative PCR, respectively, in 11 carriers of the 3 most

  abstract = "The relative importance between additive and non-additive genetic
              variance has been widely argued in quantitative genetics. By
              approaching this question from an evolutionary perspective we
              show that, while additive variance can be maintained under
              selection at a low level for some patterns of epistasis, the
              majority of the genetic variance that will persist is actually
              non-additive. We propose that one reason that the problem of the
              ``missing heritability'' arises is because the additive genetic
              variation that is estimated to be contributing to the variance of
              a trait will most likely be an artefact of the non-additive
              variance that can be maintained over evolutionary time. In
              addition, it can be shown that even a small reduction in linkage
              disequilibrium between causal variants and observed SNPs rapidly
              erodes estimates of epistatic variance, leading to an inflation
              in the perceived importance of additive effects. We demonstrate
              that the perception of independent additive effects comprising
              the majority of the genetic architecture of complex traits is
              biased upwards and that the search for causal variants in complex
              traits under selection is potentially underpowered by
              parameterising for additive effects alone. Given dense SNP panels
              the detection of causal variants through genome-wide association

  abstract = "Risk for late-onset Alzheimer's disease (LOAD), the most
              prevalent dementia, is partially driven by genetics. To identify
              LOAD risk loci, we performed a large genome-wide association
              meta-analysis of clinically diagnosed LOAD (94,437 individuals).
              We confirm 20 previous LOAD risk loci and identify five new
              genome-wide loci (IQCK, ACE, ADAM10, ADAMTS1, and WWOX), two of
              which (ADAM10, ACE) were identified in a recent genome-wide
              association (GWAS)-by-familial-proxy of Alzheimer's or dementia.
              Fine-mapping of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region confirms
              the neurological and immune-mediated disease haplotype HLA-DR15
              as a risk factor for LOAD. Pathway analysis implicates immunity,
              lipid metabolism, tau binding proteins, and amyloid precursor
              protein (APP) metabolism, showing that genetic variants affecting
              APP and A$\beta$ processing are associated not only with
              early-onset autosomal dominant Alzheimer's disease but also with
              LOAD. Analyses of risk genes and pathways show enrichment for
              rare variants (P = 1.32 $\times$ 10), indicating that additional
              rare variants remain to be identified. We also identify important

  abstract = "The ATP-binding cassette (ABC) reporter family functions to
              regulate the homeostasis of phospholipids and cholesterol in the
              central nervous system, as well as peripheral tissues. ABCA7
              belongs to the A subfamily of ABC transporters, which shares 54\%
              sequence identity with ABCA1. While ABCA7 is expressed in a
              variety of tissues/organs, including the brain, recent
              genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified ABCA7 gene
              variants as susceptibility loci for late-onset Alzheimer's
              disease (AD). More important, subsequent genome sequencing
              analyses have revealed that premature termination codon mutations
              in ABCA7 are associated with the increased risk for AD.
              Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disease
              and the most common cause of dementia, where the accumulation and
              deposition of amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides cleaved from
              amyloid precursor protein (APP) in the brain trigger the
              pathogenic cascade of the disease. In consistence with human
              genetic studies, increasing evidence has demonstrated that ABCA7
              deficiency exacerbates A$\beta$ pathology using in vitro and in
              vivo models. While ABCA7 has been shown to mediate phagocytic
              activity in macrophages, ABCA7 is also involved in the microglial
              A$\beta$ clearance pathway. Furthermore, ABCA7 deficiency results
              in accelerated A$\beta$ production, likely by facilitating
              endocytosis and/or processing of APP. Taken together, current
              evidence suggests that ABCA7 loss-of-function contributes to
              AD-related phenotypes through multiple pathways. A better
              understanding of the function of ABCA7 beyond lipid metabolism in
              both physiological and pathological conditions becomes
              increasingly important to explore AD pathogenesis.",

              available blood nutrients and metabolize them to fulfil their own
              energy needs and deliver metabolic intermediates to local
              synapses. These glial cells should be, therefore, metabolically
              adaptable to swap different substrates. However, in vitro and in
              vivo studies consistently show that astrocytes are primarily
              glycolytic, suggesting glucose is their main metabolic precursor.
              Notably, transcriptomic data and in vitro studies reveal that
              mouse astrocytes are capable of mitochondrially oxidizing fatty
              acids and that they can detoxify excess neuronal-derived fatty
              acids in disease models. Still, the factual metabolic advantage
              of fatty acid use by astrocytes and its physiological impact on
              higher-order cerebral functions remain unknown. Here, we show
              that knockout of carnitine-palmitoyl transferase-1A (CPT1A)-a key
              enzyme of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation-in adult mouse
              astrocytes causes cognitive impairment. Mechanistically,
              decreased fatty acid oxidation rewired astrocytic pyruvate

              mitochondrial respiratory chain, resulting in attenuation of
              reactive oxygen species formation. Thus, astrocytes naturally
              metabolize fatty acids to preserve the mitochondrial respiratory
              chain in an energetically inefficient disassembled conformation
              that secures signalling reactive oxygen species and sustains

              obesity, a major public health concern in many countries.
              Increasing basal energy expenditure has been proposed as a
              strategy to fight obesity yet raises efficiency and safety
              concerns. Here, we show that mice deficient for a muscle-specific
              enzyme of very-long-chain fatty acid synthesis display increased
              basal energy expenditure and protection against high-fat
              diet-induced obesity. Mechanistically, muscle-specific modulation
              of the very-long-chain fatty acid pathway was associated with a
              reduced content of the inner mitochondrial membrane phospholipid
              cardiolipin and a blunted coupling efficiency between the
              respiratory chain and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) synthase,
              which was restored by cardiolipin enrichment. Our study reveals
              that selective increase of lipid oxidative capacities in skeletal
              muscle, through the cardiolipin-dependent lowering of
              mitochondrial ATP production, provides an effective option
              against obesity at the whole-body level.",

              mechanisms in Alzheimer's disease. This study explores a battery
              of plasma lipids that can differentiate Alzheimer's disease (AD)
              patients from healthy controls and determines whether lipid
              profiles correlate with genetic risk for AD. AD plasma samples
              were collected from the Sydney Memory and Ageing Study (MAS)
              Sydney, Australia (aged range 75-97 years; 51.2\% male).
              Untargeted lipidomics analysis was performed by liquid
              chromatography coupled-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We found
              that several lipid species from nine lipid classes, particularly
              sphingomyelins (SMs), cholesterol esters (ChEs),
              phosphatidylcholines (PCs), phosphatidylethanolamines (PIs),
              phosphatidylinositols (PIs), and triglycerides (TGs) are
              dysregulated in AD patients and may help discriminate them from
              healthy controls. However, when the lipid species were grouped
              together into lipid subgroups, only the DG group was
              significantly higher in AD. ChEs, SMs, and TGs resulted in good
              classification accuracy using the Glmnet algorithm (elastic net
              penalization for the generalized linear model [glm]) with more
              than 80\% AUC. In general, group lipids and the lipid subclasses
              LPC and PE had less classification accuracy compared to the other
              subclasses. We also found significant increases in SMs, PIs, and
              the LPE/PE ratio in human U251 astroglioma cell lines exposed to
              pathophysiological concentrations of oligomeric A$\beta$. This
              suggests that oligomeric A$\beta$ plays a contributory, if not
              causal role, in mediating changes in lipid profiles in AD that
              can be detected in the periphery. In addition, we evaluated the
              association of plasma lipid profiles with AD-related single
              nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and polygenic risk scores (PRS)
              of AD. We found that FERMT2 and MS4A6A showed a significantly
              differential association with lipids in all lipid classes across
              disease and control groups. ABCA7 had a differential association
              with more than half of the DG lipids (52.63\%) and PI lipids
              (57.14\%), respectively. Additionally, 43.4\% of lipids in the SM
              class were differentially associated with CLU. More than 30\% of
              lipids in ChE, PE, and TG classes had differential associations
              with separate genes (ChE-PICALM, SLC24A4, and SORL1; PE-CLU and
              CR1; TG-BINI) between AD and control group. These data may

              cytochrome (Cyt ) also plays a critical role in the initiation of
              mitochondrially induced apoptosis through specific interactions
              with cardiolipin (CL), a negatively charged phospholipid found in
              the inner mitochondrial membrane. In this work, we study the
              conformational dynamics of Cyt in the presence of CL and
              phosphatidylcholine (PC) phospholipids also present in the
              mitochondrial membrane to better understand how these

              heterogeneity in the lipid-bound ensemble, with zwitterionic (PC)
              phospholipids inducing destabilization of residues necessary for
              peroxidase coordination, and increased dynamics on the proximal

              expected from classical models for CL-driven Cyt peroxidase

  abstract  = "In Alzheimer9s disease (AD), the accumulation and deposition of
               amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides in the brain is a central
               event. A$\beta$ is cleaved from amyloid precursor protein (APP)
               by $\beta$-secretase and $\gamma$-secretase mainly in neurons.
               Although mutations in APP, PS1, or PS2 cause early-onset
               familial AD, ABCA7 encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter A7
               is one of the susceptibility genes for late-onset AD (LOAD), in
               which its loss-of-function variants increase the disease risk.
               ABCA7 is homologous to a major lipid transporter ABCA1 and is
               highly expressed in neurons and microglia in the brain. Here, we
               show that ABCA7 deficiency altered brain lipid profile and
               impaired memory in ABCA7 knock-out (Abca7−/−) mice. When bred to
               amyloid model APP/PS1 mice, plaque burden was exacerbated by
               ABCA7 deficit. In vivo microdialysis studies indicated that the
               clearance rate of A$\beta$ was unaltered. Interestingly, ABCA7
               deletion facilitated the processing of APP to A$\beta$ by
               increasing the levels of $\beta$-site APP cleaving enzyme 1
               (BACE1) and sterol regulatory element-binding protein 2 (SREBP2)
               in primary neurons and mouse brains. Knock-down of ABCA7
               expression in neurons caused endoplasmic reticulum stress
               highlighted by increased level of protein kinase R-like
               endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK) and increased
               phosphorylation of eukaryotic initiation factor 2$\alpha$
               (eIF2$\alpha$). In the brains of APP/PS1;Abca7−/− mice, the
               level of phosphorylated extracellular regulated kinase (ERK) was
               also significantly elevated. Together, our results reveal novel
               pathways underlying the association of ABCA7 dysfunction and
               LOAD pathogenesis.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Gene variants in ABCA7
               encoding ATP-binding cassette transporter A7 are associated with
               the increased risk for late-onset Alzheimer9s disease (AD).
               Importantly, we found the altered brain lipid profile and
               impaired memory in ABCA7 knock-out mice. The accumulation of
               amyloid-$\beta$ (A$\beta$) peptides cleaved from amyloid
               precursor protein (APP) in the brain is a key event in AD
               pathogenesis and we also found that ABCA7 deficit exacerbated
               brain A$\beta$ deposition in amyloid AD model APP/PS1 mice.
               Mechanistically, we found that ABCA7 deletion facilitated the
               processing of APP and A$\beta$ production by increasing the
               levels of $\beta$-secretase 1 (BACE1) in primary neurons and
               mouse brains without affecting the A$\beta$ clearance rate in
               APP/PS1 mice. Our study demonstrates a novel mechanism
               underlying how dysfunctions of ABCA7 contribute to the risk for
               AD.",

               Parkinson's disease (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS),
               and multiple sclerosis (MS), currently represent major unmet
               medical needs. Therefore, novel therapeutic strategies are
               needed in order to improve patients' quality of life and
               prognosis. Since oxidative stress can be strongly involved in
               neurodegenerative diseases, the potential use of inosine, known
               for its antioxidant properties, in this context deserves
               particular attention. The protective action of inosine treatment
               could be mediated by its metabolite urate. Here, we review the
               current preclinical and clinical studies investigating the use
               of inosine in AD, PD, ALS, and MS. The most important properties
               of inosine seem to be its antioxidant action and its ability to
               raise urate levels and to increase energetic resources by
               improving ATP availability. Inosine appears to be generally safe
               and well tolerated; however, the possible formation of kidney
               stones should be monitored, and data on its effectiveness should
               be further explored since, so far, they have been controversial.
               Overall, inosine could be a promising potential strategy in the
               management of neurodegenerative diseases, and additional studies
               are needed in order to further investigate its safety and

              acid oxidation (FAOx), exerts at least some of its hypophagic
              effects via neuronal mechanisms in the hypothalamus. In the
              present work, we characterized the effects of C75 and another
              anorexigenic compound, the glycerol-3-phosphate acyltransferase
              (GPAT) inhibitor FSG67, on FA metabolism, metabolomics profiles,
              and metabolic stress responses in cultured hypothalamic neurons
              and hypothalamic neuronal cell lines during lipid excess with
              palmitate. Both compounds enhanced palmitate oxidation, increased

              inflammatory and cell stress responses. This shift would restore

              making APOE status highly relevant toward clinical trial design
              and AD research broadly. The associations of APOE genotypes with
              AD are modulated by age, sex, race and ethnicity, and ancestry,
              but these associations remain unclear, particularly among racial
              and ethnic groups understudied in the AD and genetics research
              fields. OBJECTIVE: To assess the stratified associations of APOE
              genotypes with AD risk across sex, age, race and ethnicity, and
              global population ancestry. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS: This
              genetic association study included case-control, family-based,
              population-based, and longitudinal AD-related cohorts that
              recruited referred and volunteer participants. Data were analyzed
              between March 2022 and April 2023. Genetic data were available
              from high-density, single-nucleotide variant microarrays, exome
              microarrays, and whole-exome and whole-genome sequencing. Summary
              statistics were ascertained from published AD genetic studies.
              MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The main outcomes were risk for AD
              (odds ratios [ORs]) and risk of conversion to AD (hazard ratios
              [HRs]), with 95\% CIs. Risk for AD was evaluated through
              case-control logistic regression analyses. Risk of conversion to
              AD was evaluated through Cox proportional hazards regression
              survival analyses. RESULTS: Among 68 756 unique individuals,
              analyses included 21 852 East Asian (demographic data not
              available), 5738 Hispanic (68.2\% female; mean [SD] age, 75.4
              [8.8] years), 7145 non-Hispanic Black (hereafter referred to as
              Black) (70.8\% female; mean [SD] age, 78.4 [8.2] years), and 34
              021 non-Hispanic White (hereafter referred to as White) (59.3\%
              female; mean [SD] age, 77.0 [9.1] years) individuals. There was a
              general, stepwise pattern of ORs for APOE*4 genotypes and AD risk
              across race and ethnicity groups. Odds ratios for APOE*34 and AD
              risk attenuated following East Asian (OR, 4.54; 95\% CI,
              3.99-5.17),White (OR, 3.46; 95\% CI, 3.27-3.65), Black (OR, 2.18;
              95\% CI, 1.90-2.49) and Hispanic (OR, 1.90; 95\% CI, 1.65-2.18)
              individuals. Similarly, ORs for APOE*22+23 and AD risk attenuated
              following White (OR, 0.53, 95\% CI, 0.48-0.58), Black (OR, 0.69,
              95\% CI, 0.57-0.84), and Hispanic (OR, 0.89; 95\% CI, 0.72-1.10)
              individuals, with no association for Hispanic individuals.
              Deviating from the global pattern of ORs, APOE*22+23 was not
              associated with AD risk in East Asian individuals (OR, 0.97; 95\%
              CI, 0.77-1.23). Global population ancestry could not explain why
              Hispanic individuals showed APOE associations with less
              pronounced AD risk compared with Black and White individuals.
              Within Black individuals, decreased global African ancestry or
              increased global European ancestry showed a pattern of APOE*4
              dosage associated with increasing AD risk, but no such pattern
              was apparent for APOE*2 dosage with AD risk. The
              sex-by-age-specific interaction effect of APOE*34 among White
              individuals (higher risk in women) was reproduced but shifted to
              ages 60 to 70 years (OR, 1.48; 95\% CI, 1.10-2.01) and was
              additionally replicated in a meta-analysis of Black individuals
              and Hispanic individuals (OR, 1.72; 95\% CI, 1.01-2.94).
              CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: Through recent advances in AD-related
              genetic cohorts, this study provided the largest-to-date overview
              of the association of APOE with AD risk across age, sex, race and

  title     = "Mitochondrial phospholipids: role in mitochondrial function",
  author    = "Mejia, Edgard M and Hatch, Grant M",
  abstract  = "Mitochondria are essential components of eukaryotic cells and
               are involved in a diverse set of cellular processes that include
               ATP production, cellular signalling, apoptosis and cell growth.
               These organelles are thought to have originated from a symbiotic
               relationship between prokaryotic cells in an effort to provide a
               bioenergetic jump and thus, the greater complexity observed in
               eukaryotes (Lane and Martin 2010). Mitochondrial processes are
               required not only for the maintenance of cellular homeostasis,
               but also allow cell to cell and tissue to tissue communication
               (Nunnari and Suomalainen 2012). Mitochondrial phospholipids are
               important components of this system. Phospholipids make up the
               characteristic outer and inner membranes that give mitochondria
               their shape. In addition, these membranes house sterols,
               sphingolipids and a wide variety of proteins. It is the
               phospholipids that also give rise to other characteristic
               mitochondrial structures such as cristae (formed from the
               invaginations of the inner mitochondrial membrane), the matrix
               (area within cristae) and the intermembrane space (IMS) which
               separates the outer mitochondrial membrane (OMM) and inner
               mitochondrial membrane (IMM). Phospholipids are the building
               blocks that make up these structures. However, the phospholipid
               composition of the OMM and IMM is unique in each membrane.
               Mitochondria are able to synthesize some of the phospholipids it
               requires, but the majority of cellular lipid biosynthesis takes
               place in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) in conjunction with the
               Golgi apparatus (Fagone and Jackowski 2009). In this review, we
               will focus on the role that mitochondrial phospholipids play in
               specific cellular functions and discuss their biosynthesis,
               metabolism and transport as well as the differences between the
               OMM and IMM phospholipid composition. Finally, we will focus on
               the human diseases that result from disturbances to
               mitochondrial phospholipids and the current research being
               performed to help us gain a better understanding of their
               function.",

               multiple health beneficial effects. Although their roles in
               cancer treatment and prevention have been extensively reported,
               interestingly, they may also have distinctive properties in
               energy metabolism and metabolic disorders. We review inositols
               and inositol phosphate metabolism in mammalian cells to
               establish their biological activities and highlight their
               potential roles in energy metabolism. These molecules are known
               to decrease insulin resistance, increase insulin sensitivity,
               and have diverse properties with importance from cell signaling
               to metabolism. Evidence showed that inositol phosphates might
               enhance the browning of white adipocytes and directly improve
               insulin sensitivity through adipocytes. In addition, inositol
               pyrophosphates containing high-energy phosphate bonds are
               considered in increasing cellular energetics. Despite all recent

              responsible for Stargardt disease, a degenerative disorder
              associated with severe loss in central vision. Although
              cell-based studies have implicated ABCA proteins in lipid
              transport, the substrates and direction of transport have not

              Eric S",
  abstract = "Human genetics has been haunted by the mystery of ``missing
              heritability'' of common traits. Although studies have discovered
              >1,200 variants associated with common diseases and traits, these
              variants typically appear to explain only a minority of the
              heritability. The proportion of heritability explained by a set
              of variants is the ratio of (i) the heritability due to these
              variants (numerator), estimated directly from their observed
              effects, to (ii) the total heritability (denominator), inferred
              indirectly from population data. The prevailing view has been
              that the explanation for missing heritability lies in the
              numerator--that is, in as-yet undiscovered variants. While many
              variants surely remain to be found, we show here that a
              substantial portion of missing heritability could arise from
              overestimation of the denominator, creating ``phantom
              heritability.'' Specifically, (i) estimates of total heritability
              implicitly assume the trait involves no genetic interactions
              (epistasis) among loci; (ii) this assumption is not justified,
              because models with interactions are also consistent with
              observable data; and (iii) under such models, the total
              heritability may be much smaller and thus the proportion of
              heritability explained much larger. For example, 80\% of the
              currently missing heritability for Crohn's disease could be due
              to genetic interactions, if the disease involves interaction
              among three pathways. In short, missing heritability need not
              directly correspond to missing variants, because current
              estimates of total heritability may be significantly inflated by
              genetic interactions. Finally, we describe a method for
              estimating heritability from isolated populations that is not
              inflated by genetic interactions.",

  abstract = "Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) originally identified
              ATP-binding cassette, sub-family A, member 7 (ABCA7), as a novel
              risk gene of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Since then, accumulating
              evidence from in vitro, in vivo, and human-based studies has
              corroborated and extended this association, promoting ABCA7 as
              one of the most important risk genes of both early-onset and
              late-onset AD, harboring both common and rare risk variants with
              relatively large effect on AD risk. Within this review, we
              provide a comprehensive assessment of the literature on ABCA7,
              with a focus on AD-related human -omics studies (e.g. genomics,
              transcriptomics, and methylomics). In European and African
              American populations, indirect ABCA7 GWAS associations are
              explained by expansion of an ABCA7 variable number tandem repeat
              (VNTR), and a common premature termination codon (PTC) variant,
              respectively. Rare ABCA7 PTC variants are strongly enriched in AD
              patients, and some of these have displayed inheritance patterns
              resembling autosomal dominant AD. In addition, rare missense
              variants are more frequent in AD patients than healthy controls,
              whereas a common ABCA7 missense variant may protect from disease.
              Methylation at several CpG sites in the ABCA7 locus is
              significantly associated with AD. Furthermore, ABCA7 contains
              many different isoforms and ABCA7 splicing has been shown to
              associate with AD. Besides associations with disease status,
              these genetic and epigenetic ABCA7 markers also showed
              significant correlations with AD endophenotypes; in particular
              amyloid deposition and brain morphology. In conclusion,
              human-based -omics studies provide converging evidence of
              (partial) ABCA7 loss as an AD pathomechanism, and future studies
              should make clear if interventions on ABCA7 expression can serve
              as a valuable therapeutic target for AD.",
